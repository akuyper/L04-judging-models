## Overview

The goals for this lab are to continue using the `recipes` package to preform feature engineering, use the `yardstick` package to assess and compare models, and to train binary classification models.

This lab covers material up to and including [9. Judging model effectiveness](https://www.tmwr.org/performance.html) from [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/). We are tying up the bare minimum needed to build predictive models using `tidymodels`.

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L04_judging_models.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L04.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
